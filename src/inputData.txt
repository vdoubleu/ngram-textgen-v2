One of the greatest advantages the human species has is its ability to communicate their thoughts and work with others. This strength can be best seen in the human species’ strive to produce knowledge. Our production of knowledge is always done collaboratively and never as an individual. This idea may seem far fetched at first but it can easily be proven. All you need is to analyze the fringe cases and answer the question ‘can there be collaboration when a knower is alone?’ We can answer this question by analyzing its place in two opposing subjects: natural science and ethics to see how it applies. We will also look at the place of reasoning and imagination in these areas. Before we can continue, one must first define what is meant by alone as it will be core to the arguments made. In this case, when one is alone, one is not near any other contributors to the project both spatially and chronologically. If knowledge is a justified true belief, then the production of knowledge is the creation of new knowledge for a particular knower. Collaboration is the production of knowledge with another person such that both side’s ideas are incorporated. Armed with this, it is now possible to analyze this statement. The first area of knowledge from which we will analyze this question is the natural sciences. In the natural sciences, knowledge can be gained from a variety of sources. However, almost all of them can be considered a piece of collaborative work after one carefully analyzes the situation regardless of how that knowledge was gained. An example of this can be seen in physics. In physics class, we discussed how relativity, a section of physics, was developed by Einstein. We talked about how he made these discoveries mainly through thought experiments. (Sundermier, 2016) He arrived at these discovers with very little help from outside sources; using only his power of reasoning and imagination. So, from one perspective, you could say he created the knowledge completely alone and without any outside help. However, if you were to look at his papers, his development of knowledge incorporated aspects of many other people’s works. His work would not have been possible without the work of those before him. He built one of his main postulates off observations of light and how its speed never changed. Even if we exclude that, we could still say that his theories built off the theories of others. Something as simple as the formula for velocity, velocity = distance/time, or the Pythagorean theorem. (The light clock - A theoretical proof of time dilation) Also, if physicists long ago had not created theories on how light functions, Einstein would never have been able to utilise aspects of it in his process.
